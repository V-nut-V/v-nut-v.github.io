        <h1>Meet the Maker</h1>
        <p><em>David Trubridge Ltd was formed in 1995 when David started to expand his operation from his small designer/maker business.</em></p>
        <p>David's work came to prominence in 2001 when the Italian design house Cappellini bought the rights for Body Raft. The Coral light followed in 2004 for DTL, establishing a blueprint for kit-set products that minimised environmental footprint. The company is proud to hold Life Cycle Assessments (LCA’s) and Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs).</p>
        <p>David's designs have featured in countless international publications including the most influential, as an instigator of the trend of 'raw sophistication' and as an exemplar of environmentally responsible design. In 2008 the French magazine Express listed him as one of the top 15 designers in the world, and in 2012 the Pompidou Centre in Paris purchased his 'Icarus' installation for its permanent collection.</p>
