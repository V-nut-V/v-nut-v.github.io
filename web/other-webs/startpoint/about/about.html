    <h1>About the website</h1>
    <h2>What is the website?</h2>
    <p>This website collects and filters some free and nice tutorials for study graphic design from the internet.</p>
    <h2>Who is the website for?</h2>
    <p>
      If you are interested in some digital visual stuff showing on a computer or your mobile phone or some special effect showing on TV or movie and you do not have any experience in making it, it’s worth to have look on this web. Also, it for people who have experience in graphic design, but want to review or expand on other areas of graphic design. Furthermore, it could be for a student who before getting to school, they can get to know graphic design to see if they really like it and to get their feet wet. For sure, the knowledge of this web include is limited by my view and if you have some advice and suggestions, please send to my email (harley9387@gmail.com), I will be really happy with that.
    </p>
    <h2>Why is that?</h2>
    <p>Most of them made tutorials is driven by passion instead of profit, so that we will feel interesting and enjoy to learn it under such atmosphere.</p>
    <h2>What features on this website?</h2>
    <p>I (the web auther) try to systematically construct some things which are basic knowledge of graphic design. So that, people who want to learn graphic design don’t have to randomly learn graphic design from somewhere else and clearly know what they learn and use for.</p>
    <h2>How to use it?</h2>
    <p>Personally, I suggest that we can start at “design principle” part, and then, begin to learn “software” part with the curiosity which is how to achieve it. At that point, theoretically, we can do a lot of graphic design project already. At last, learn something by a project to indirectly gain some experience. Or you can start at anywhere you want, to maintain enthusiasm and keep things going is important.</p>
