        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>He waka eke noa refers to a research partnership that seeks to create a public artwork with the working title ‘The Matariki Waka’. It is being built with a stainless-steel skeleton and clad in 3mm corten plate, and will utilise an interactive design that engages with the seven stars of Matariki through LED lighting and ambient soundtracks. These will be informed by the movements of participants combined with an Internet of Things environmental sensor network, and will primarily operate at dawn and dusk.</p>
        <p>This work will be situated at Hamilton’s Ferrybank Park, having gained unanimous consent from the Hamilton City Council at both its concept and siting stages. It is a collaborative, consultative, multidisciplinary partnership with Wintec’s Maaori </p>
        <p>Achievement office, with guidance being provided by local kaumatua Tame Pokaia. Students from across Trades, Engineering, Early Childhood Education, and Media Arts, have worked on the project to date, and next year will see this happen again on a greater scale. This project is being made with the support and partnership of Wintec researchers, ITS, and PhD candidate and artist Joe Citizen.</p>
        <p>The aims of the project are multiple, and include: Celebrating the importance and interconnected nature of the Waikato river – in all its physical, spiritual, historical, and mental capacities – through the movements, vibrations and temperatures of human and non-human participants (such as animals, the weather, the seasons, phases of the moon, plant growth, the river itself etc.); helping students gain industry-ready skills through a unique collaborative project that values their contributions so that they become co-creators in the work; and providing new opportunities for long-term relationships between Wintec and Hamilton City Council, industry, mana whenua, and the people of Hamilton.</p>
        <p>Current industry partnerships include Longveld, ACLX, and MechEng. Over $100,000 of funding has been secured so far, with donations, grants, and in-kind received from Perry’s, Trust Waikato, WEL Trust, Longveld, and Wintec. Sustainable energy options have been researched by Electrical Engineering students, and next year will see their implementation, using solar and wind solutions.</p>
        <p>The primary audience/ participants of this endeavour are rangatahi and young families, both in the finished work and in its process of becoming a reality.</p>
